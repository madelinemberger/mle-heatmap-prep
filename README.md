## Repository to collaborate on scripts and functions to prepare MLE OUS data

This repository contains scripts, functions and data that anyone working with OUS data collected on SeaSketch Legacy can reference when cleaning and organizing the shapes. 
It is organized into the following folders:

- **inputs**: All input data used can be found in this folder. This includes shapes collected from the survey, and any other data we need to use in the preparation process, such administrative boundaries
- **outputs**: Shapefiles sorted by categories - for the MLE process, this means separate sector shapes for each atoll, and therefore separate folders for each atoll within the outputs folder
- **R**: Scripts that can be called to execute specific process or load custom functions
